# COVID19-Web-Scrapping

This repository contains a few Python Notebook I created to collect data of COVID-19 cases from the government website.

Here are list of a few libraries I use in this project:
* Selenium: to automate the webscrapping process
* request: to collect data directly from the site's API (if available)
* Pandas: to organize the data collected
* re: to process string
